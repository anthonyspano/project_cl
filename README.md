32-bit action rpg (in progress)

The goal here is to make a top-down action rpg reminiscent to Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. This project is intended for learning purposes. Please feel free to take any code and 
play with it :).

If you would like to contribute shoot me a message, artists and programmers alike.
